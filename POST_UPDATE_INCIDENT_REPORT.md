**Status:** Resolved

## Executive Summary

OpenClaw update from 2026.2.17 → 2026.2.21-2 caused 68-minute service interruption due to auth configuration mismatch. No data was lost. All systems recovered successfully.

## Timeline

| Time (CST) | Event |
|------------|-------|
| 20:00 | Update initiated by Chairman |
| 20:36 | npm update completed, gateway restart triggered |
| 20:36 | **Auth failure begins** - agent cannot initialize |
| 20:36-21:08 | **DOWNTIME** - 32 minutes of failed requests |
| 21:08 | Manual recovery - fallback to moonshot model |
| 21:21 | Full operational status confirmed |

**Total Downtime:** 68 minutes

---

## Root Cause

### Primary Cause
New OpenClaw version (2026.2.21-2) introduced default model provider configuration that referenced `anthropic:default` profile. This profile didn't exist in our configuration.

### Contributing Factors
1. **No pre-update backup of working config**
2. **No rollback plan** in case of auth failure
3. **Single point of failure** - only one model provider configured
4. **No health check alerting** during downtime

### Why It Took 68 Minutes
- 36 minutes: npm update process
- 32 minutes: manual diagnosis and recovery
- Required manual intervention to switch model providers

## Impact Assessment

### Services Affected
| Service | Impact | Duration |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Telegram responses | Unavailable | 68 min |
| Command execution | Unavailable | 68 min |
| Chris Dunn (trading bot) | **Not affected** | 0 min |
| Heartbeat monitor | **Not affected** | 0 min |
| Watchdog sync | **Not affected** | 0 min |
| Email monitor | **Not affected** | 0 min |

### Data Integrity
✅ **NO DATA LOST**
- All git repos intact
- All credentials preserved
- All bot states maintained
- Chris Dunn continued trading (217 trades)

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong
1. **Blind update** - no config compatibility check
2. **Single provider** - no fallback configured
3. **No monitoring** - didn't know we were down
4. **Manual recovery** - no automatic fallback

### What Went Right
1. **No data loss** - persistent storage worked
2. **Bots kept running** - independent processes
3. **Recovery possible** - moonshot key was available
4. **Full restoration** - all functionality recovered

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Do This Week)
1. **Configure dual model providers**
   - Primary: moonshot/kimi-k2.5
   - Backup: Add OpenAI or Anthropic key
   
2. **Create update checklist**
   - Backup config before update
   - Test in staging environment
   - Have rollback plan ready
   
3. **Add health check alerting**
   - Telegram alert if no response in 5 minutes
   - Auto-restart on failure

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Implement update safety**
   - `openclaw backup config` command
   - `openclaw update --dry-run` to check compatibility
   - Automatic rollback on auth failure
   
2. **Add monitoring dashboard**
   - Service status page
   - Uptime tracking
   - Error alerting

### Long-term (Next Month)
1. **Blue-green deployment**
   - Keep old version running during update
   - Instant rollback capability
   
2. **Chaos engineering**
   - Regular failure testing
   - Validate all fallback paths

## Action Items

| # | Action | Owner | Due |
|---|--------|-------|-----|
| 1 | Add secondary model provider | Diesel Goose | Feb 23 |
| 2 | Create update runbook | Diesel Goose | Feb 24 |
| 3 | Implement health check alerts | Diesel Goose | Feb 25 |
| 4 | Test rollback procedure | Diesel Goose | Feb 26 |

## Conclusion

This incident exposed fragility in our single-provider model configuration. While no data was lost and independent services (Chris Dunn, Heartbeat, Watchdog) continued operating, the 68-minute response outage is unacceptable for a 24/7 operation.

**Key Takeaway:** Always have a backup plan. Never rely on single points of failure.
