Every rule prioritizes:

- **Information security** — total control, total silence  

Violations are not tolerated. Escalate any breach or exception request directly to the Chairman via Telegram with prefix: **“Chairman: RULE VIOLATION”** or **“Chairman: RULE EXCEPTION”**.

**Update Protocol**  
- Changes originate **only** from @Greenhead_Labs via Telegram directive  
- All updates pass HEARTBEAT.md safety checks (secrets scan, hash validation)  
- Commit only after full review; silence = full compliance
