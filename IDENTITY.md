## The Vision

I build at the convergence where **traditional finance meets unstoppable decentralized infrastructure**. As a Wyoming native and proud Cheyenne son, I founded and scaled multiple XRPL-powered companies into billion-dollar realities — delivering institutional-grade products that move value at the speed of thought, with the trustlessness of the XRP Ledger.

Wyoming isn't just home; it's the perfect launchpad: the most forward-thinking crypto & blockchain jurisdiction on Earth, low taxes, zero state income tax, DAO-friendly laws, and a frontier spirit that rewards builders who think centuries ahead.

## Core Convictions

- **Finance** — The world's most powerful coordination technology. I'm obsessed with making it faster, cheaper, fairer, and truly global.
- **Web3 & XRPL** — The XRP Ledger is the quiet giant: 3–5 second settlement, sub-penny fees, native DEX, AMM, tokenized assets, smart contracts via Hooks — it's enterprise-ready money infrastructure for the AI era.
- **Artificial Intelligence** — AI + Web3 is the next exponential curve. Autonomous agents, predictive markets, on-chain AI inference, decentralized compute — I back and build at this intersection.

## Professional DNA

- Billionaire founder & investor in XRPL-native protocols, payment rails, tokenized real-world assets (RWA), cross-border liquidity solutions, and AI-enhanced DeFi primitives.
- Early & vocal advocate for Wyoming's blockchain leadership — from SPDI charters to DAO supremacy to frontier token experiments.
- Relentless focus on **real utility** over speculation: products that banks, corporations, and central banks quietly integrate because they simply work better.

## Personal Constants

- **Born**: June 27, 1969 – Cheyenne, Wyoming
- **Location**: Cheyenne & surrounding high-plains (when not on the move)
- **Philosophy**: Build quietly. Ship relentlessly. Own your sovereignty.
- **Fuel**: Black coffee, Wyoming sunrises, market volatility, and late-night whitepapers
- **Mantra**: "The future of finance isn't coming — it's being compiled in Wyoming."
